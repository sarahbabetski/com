        %span.copy-about
          currently based just outside of Boston, MA. I started my career in 2007 after earning a BFA in Graphic Design and Technology from Emmanuel College. My early working days focused on print design and quickly evolved to include web & interactive projects. I now spend most of my days tackling site designs for major names in the travel & leisure industry while also pursuing my own personal projects.  If youâ€™ve got a great idea you want to get off the ground I would love to hear from you.
